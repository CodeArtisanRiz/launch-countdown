# Launch Countdown

Launch Countdown is a JavaScript package that provides a simple countdown timer for your website or web application. It allows you to display a countdown to a specified date and time, and auto reloads the page when the countdown reaches zero. Use it to build anticipation for product launches, events, or any other important milestones.
